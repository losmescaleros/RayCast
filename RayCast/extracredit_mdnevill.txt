## Arbitrarily Sized Images and Interface Windows

The file 'window.txt' defines the window settings that the program will use. This file consists of a 
single line which contains pixel width and height as well as world unit width and height. Pixel width 
and height describe the size of the interface window in pixels, while the world unit width and height
describe interface window width and height in global coordinate size.

### File Format

```
*pixel_width* *pixel_height* *world_unit_width* *world_unit_height*
```

### Example File Content

## Multiple and Arbitrarily Located Lights

The file 'lights.txt' defines the lights within the rendered scene. Each line in the file describes a single
light's location in world coordinates and color, as well as ambient, diffuse, and specular values. The first
three terms are world coordinates which are interpreted as floats. The next triplet defines the color values
ranging from 0 - 255. The last triplet defines the ambient, diffuse, and specular terms in a range from 0 to 1.

### File Format

```
*x* *y* *z*  *red_color_value* *green_color_value* *blue_color_value* *ambient* *diffuse* *specular*
```

### Example File Content

```
